# Logo Setup Instructions

Please save the Limitless Brain Lab logo as `/public/images/logo.png`

## Requirements:
- **Filename**: `logo.png` 
- **Location**: `/public/images/logo.png`
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred)
- **Size**: 200x200px minimum (will be automatically resized)
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## Current Implementation:
The application has been updated to use the new logo in:

✅ **Header Component** - Main navigation logo (40x40px, circular)
✅ **Footer Component** - Brand footer logo (32x32px, circular)  
✅ **Navigation Component** - Dashboard navigation logo (32x32px, circular)
✅ **Brand Names** - Updated from "Limitless Brain Wellness" to "Limitless Brain Lab"
✅ **Fallback System** - Graceful fallback to "LBL" initials if logo doesn't load

## Fallback Behavior:
If the logo file is not found, the system will automatically display:
- A gradient circle background (brain-500 to wellness-500)
- "LBL" initials in white text
- Maintains all hover animations and responsive behavior

## Testing:
Once you place the logo file at `/public/images/logo.png`, it will automatically appear across all components.
