# Founder Images

This directory should contain high-quality professional photos of the founders:

## Required Images:

### Dr. Sweta Adatia
- **Filename**: `dr-sweta-adatia.jpg`
- **Recommended specs**: 
  - Size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio)
  - Format: JPG or PNG
  - Quality: High resolution, professional headshot
  - Background: Professional or neutral background

## Image Guidelines:

1. **Professional Quality**: Use high-resolution, well-lit professional photos
2. **Consistent Style**: Maintain similar lighting and composition across all founder photos  
3. **Square Format**: Crop images to square aspect ratio for consistent display
4. **File Size**: Optimize for web (under 200KB recommended)
5. **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase, hyphenated format: `first-last-name.jpg`

## Adding Images:

1. Place the image files in this directory (`/public/images/founders/`)
2. Ensure the filename matches exactly what's referenced in `/src/data/founders.ts`
3. The images will be automatically served at `/images/founders/[filename]`

## Current References:

- Dr. Sweta Adatia: `/images/founders/dr-sweta-adatia.jpg`

## Fallback Display:

If images are not available, the system will display initials in a gradient circle as a professional fallback.
